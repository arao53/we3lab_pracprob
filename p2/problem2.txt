Simulate the July 2023 energy bill (customer, demand, and energy) for a baseload (i.e. constant in time) 
electricity consumer of 2000kW and 0therm (on 1 meter). 

For the tariff structure, assume the utility rates from the Huntington Beach, CA wastewater 
treatment plant. Helper functions can be found at: https://github.com/we3lab/wwtp-energy-tariffs/tree/main

Report your results using plots, justify methods in writing, and provide all code (with comments). 
Make, list, and justify any assumptions as needed. To submit, please share a private github repository 
containing the associated files. 

**For extra credit: find the electrical carbon footprint of the same consumer in the same timeframe. 
Use the hourly grid carbon intensity measurements from the LDWP balancing authority within CAISO/CISO. 
API/data found here: https://gridemissions.jdechalendar.su.domains/#/code
(hint: the grid carbon intensity can be estimated by dividing the consumption-based emissions by the total consumption).
