Simulate the July 2023 energy bill (customer, demand, and energy) for a baseload (i.e. constant in time) 
electricity consumer of 2000kW and 0therm (on 1 meter). 

For the tariff structure, assume the utility rates from the Huntington Beach, CA wastewater 
treatment plant. Helper functions can be found at: https://github.com/we3lab/wwtp-energy-tariffs/tree/main
